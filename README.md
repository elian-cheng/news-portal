# news-portal
News website, which collects news from newsapi.org. My first TS project, OOP. Originally the task was written in the private school repository, here is the clonned repository. [Task description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/migration-newip-to-ts.md).

## Deploy

There is no deploy for this app, because newsapi.org provides free of charge service only for the projects in development, when you open the app with localhost server. To see the app and it's functionality you need to install the project.

## Install instructions:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/elian-cheng/news-portal.git
2. cd news-portal
3. npm i
4. npm run start
```
